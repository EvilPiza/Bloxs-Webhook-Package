This is a work in progress for a roblox macro (made entirely in python)

I havent decided the game but it uses discord webhooks, similar to Natro Macro


if for whatever reason you want to make a macro using this the syntax for the macro part is

start("MESSAGE", "Starting Macro!", webhook_url, (52, 97, 235))  < For words

start("IMAGE", webhook_url)                                      < For images

In words the first parameter is the type, the second is the test, the third is webhool_url, and the last is color.
Images the first parameter is the type, second is webhook_url
