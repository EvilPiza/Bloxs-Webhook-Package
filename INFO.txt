The syntaxes for the functions are:


mention_mess(str, (rgb values))  < Rgb values could be replaced to some built in presets

message(str, (rgb values)	 < Same thing for mention_mess, rgb could be replaced

image()				 < Sends a screenshot of whats currently on screen


Some variables you 100% should change is:

default_webhook_url 		 < It is supposed to equal the user's webhook url, in quotes!

user_id				 < This has to equal the user who wants to be mentioned from mention_mess, should equal an int

image_path			 < This is the path of where the screenshot is stored, it reuses the same image.

discord_bot_token   < If your using a bot, this has to be set to the token, make sure its in quotes (str)

Some optional variables that aren't as important but still exist are:

show_time			 < Shows the current time in 24:00 H:M:S format, takes a bool value

webhook_username		 < Overwrites the name of the webhook's name to whatever you want, takes a str

webhook_gui			 < Shows a gui when default_webhook_url is set to nothing, doesn't matter much, takes a bool value

custom_gui			 < If you want a custom webhook_gui, set this to true and webhook_gui to false. Takes a bool

default_embed_color		 < The default embed color for messages, takes rgb values or any color presets


All the color presets:

"red", "blue", "green", "light red", "light blue", "light green", "dark red", "dark blue", "dark green", "white", "black", "magenta", "cyan", "yellow", "orange", "purple"

It isn't case sensitive so don't worry.


I'd recommend editing this script to fit your needs instead of messing with the variables, the code is simple and (somewhat) organized.

PS I tried to make using this super simple (even for someone who has little knowledge of coding) and not have too many functions or variables. But honestly, having a lot of functions and variables or parameters is so lame, and if you disagree, fight me.
